Project Title: Predicting Student Exam Results 

Project Description: 

Students will use a small dataset about student study habits to: 

Apply Linear Regression to predict a student’s final exam score based on hours studied. 
Use Logistic Regression to predict whether a student passes or fails based on attendance rate and study time. 
Try K-Means Clustering to group students based on their study time and attendance, then describe each group’s characteristics.

Dataset Details: 

The dataset contains the following columns: 

StudentID – Unique student identifier 
AttendanceRate – Percentage of classes attended 
StudyTime – Weekly study hours 
FinalExamScore – Exam score (0-100) 
Pass/Fail – 1 for pass, 0 for fail 
Students can use a sample dataset with about 20-30 records for easy handling in Excel or any programming language. 

Expected Learning Outcomes: 

Understand the basics of regression, classification, and clustering algorithms 
Practice applying simple machine learning methods to real data 
Interpret and discuss basic model results
